	<h1>Welcome to Emily Ryer's Personal Website!</h1>
  <p>
    This is a website with information on Emily Ryer.
    It's pretty great, seeing as it's the first website Emily has ever made.
    Someday, it'll have lots of exciting information.
    But first, here's a list of stuff I like to do!
    <ul>
      <li>Make music</li>
      <li>Play video games</li>
      <li>Draw</li>
      <li>Homework (but not really)</li>
    </ul>
